    <h1> Unit 3 Major Assignment</h1>
    <p> For my Unit 3 Major assignment, I was assigned to make a image comic with 2 tangram style svgs, a text bubble for speech, and a picture background found off of google. I was aiming to make a comic with two fish talking to each other under the sea. In the process of making it, i faced many issues with setting up the SVG. I couldn't figure out how to plot the different points for the svg to make its shape. I am not familiar with plotting and algebraic graphing, which is what SVG plotting is similar to. I had to use a lot of trial and error and really more of “winging it” than anything else. Another challenge I faced was adding the image behind the SVG for me to create the background. I spent a lot of time trying to figure it out to no avail. I then asked my professor for help, and she helped me figure out how to add it and make it work. I think I accomplished my goals well for this work as it all turned out well in the end. It was a struggle but I was able to take my chances, use my resources, and find a solution to each of my struggles. I learned how to add images to SVGs which would be beneficial for me in the future.  I can take away my knowledge of setting up file directories and css and html linking in work beyond this class as I am looking to be a web designer/developer, to which all of these skills are necessary. I could also use the SVG’s for graphic design, or even logo making in the future as well.</p>
    
     <h1> Unit 2 Major Assignment</h1>
    <p>For the Unit 2 major assignment, I was assigned to make 3 webpages, one to my design, and one that was to be accessible to others with disabilities. I made one to my design, one for the Autistic Spectrum, and another for people with low vision. I was aiming to fit the needs of the infographic describing the different accessible sites to make it best fitting for those with the disabilities/impairments. I decided to do my own design and just make whatever I wanted. For the Autistic Spectrum, I was aiming to make it the least overwhelming as possible, which was very difficult to do. Instead of keeping the Javascript code to make the generator work, I had to shut down the javascript in order for me to make it easier to read and not have to try too hard to focus. I didn't want to do that but it was my only choice. For the low vision, I made bright colors and huge fonts along with making the page bigger. It is a bit overwhelming but it very easy to see and navigate. I struggled with keeping the font at the right size. As a resolution, I had to scale down the font so that the scaling of the overall site wouldn't make the font too big. I also had to figure out how to link the 3 sites and the css files in my directory. I have learned to link different sites together and make a functional navigation bar that I have now used in other projects such as this one. I can take away making a navigation bar and different accessability options for the future of my path as a web designer, especially since it will be used a lot in the development of webpages.</p>
    <h1> SVG practice 1</h1>
    <p>For the SVG practice 1,I was assigned to create different SVG shapes with different colors then label them. I was aiming to make them work in a list and not overlap and overall meet the standards of the syllabus. I ran into a couple of challenges regarding the set up of the SVGs, but to fix it, I really just worked around with it until I was satisfied, basically trial and error. I was able to gain an understanding of the basics of SVG Design. I can take this work beyond this class through perhaps a more graphic design type of work, especially since logos are made with it so that they can be scaled without being pixelated. It will definitely help with classes that have to do with any sort of photography and editing. </p>
    <h1> SVG Practice 2</h1>
    <p>For the SVG practice 2, I was assigned to create a svg image with a house, a sun with rays, lightning bolt, and two stick people. I was aiming to make all of this possible as simple as possible. However, this was not the case. I managed to mess up the code a bit and ended up having to use large numbers to move around the svg without losing parts of the images. I didn't know what I was doing, so I just tried to wing it and mess around with the plotting until I could make it. I tried to make a lightning bolt, but couldn't make it work, so it ended up being some sort of stick thing. I made a half lightning bolt which was a start for my first SVG. After I was able to set everything up, it was almost smooth sailing, but with everything, I had to mess around with things until it looked descent. I learned that in the future, I need to use only one code for the SVG “map”, instead of creating multiple svg images and trying to make it fit when it can’t. One thing that I can take away from this assignment is to use my resources more and try to figure out how to actually plot the points and shapes for the SVGs, and that I can include more than one shape/object into the image. </p>
      <h1>CSS Quickmake</h1>
    <p>So, for the CSS Quickmake, I had a lot of fun with it. I decided to make a quick make using the html practice from a previous assignment and creating a css file to design it. My goal was to be as “extra” as possible meaning to make gradients and use different border styles while also meeting the expectations of the assignment. I faced some challenges for the assignment such as making the borders and the sizing of it. To fix said issue, I just decided to play around with it until I was satisfied with the result. I also struggled with creating a link to images or a video, but I was overall able to make it work after some extensive research. One thing that I can take away from this assignment is that I was able to improvise when needed and being able to make a functional site. I am glad that i was able to learn how to link other sites that arent from my design to my website and I see myself doing that in the future as a web designer. I learned a lot regarding the basics of web design, while also realizing that I went too far with the color scheme, and will know to use less random colors in the future. I see myself taking this to another level in another coding intensive dcd class.</p>
