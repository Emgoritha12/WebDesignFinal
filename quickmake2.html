<h1><center>Why Loki Is Not a Villain</h1> <p>
<h2><center> By Emma Williamosn</h2> <p>
<h3 id="Reasons">Reasons</h3>  First of all, Loki is not a villain for these reasons: <ul>
  <li>His older brother was the favorite</li>
  <li>He has been lied to</li>
  <li>He is a drama queen</li>
    <li>My man only wanted to be accepted from his family</li>
     <li>He was adopted</li>
    <li>He's got daddy issues</li>
    <li>He is a <b>Gemini</b> </li>
  <li>He is not a narcisist</li> <p>
   <center> Anyway, Loki is a complex character often portrayed as a villian. However, he be <i>fine</i> though. Like this man is good looking,caring, and has a unique personality unlike most heros. He is a person that people can often relate to on a personal level and is very complex, so he isnt basic. <mark>I mean, my man was abandoned, adopted, neglected, and mitreated. The only person who truly cared for him was his mother who sadly was murdered due to him giving a evil elf her location on accident </mark>. So not only did he lose the only person who understood him, he killed her, and felt bad, and he was treated as if he didnt care about her which wasnt true. Yes, he tried to invade New York, but was it really his choice. <p>
  Also, in the first Thor movie, Loki and Thor seem very close, but at times people can see his decieving nature and envy towards his older brother. He tries to become king of asgard to prove himself to his father, and as he is on the edge of a cliff about to fall, he tells his father that he could have proved himself, with hopeful eyes, however, Odin, says no, showing that he will never truly accept Loki. My poor guy tried to unalive himself. In Avengers he is like "hey, I am going to invade New York". And the Avengers are like "nah, you cant do that". So he tries anyway. But when he comes out of the portal, he is seen with sunken eyes, very sweaty, and is struggling to keep his balance; all symptoms of heat exhaustion or some form of torture. He is also angrier than before mainly due to the magic staff he got. Poor guy just wanted a family and he had to go through what Tom Hiddleston said "hell". <p>
 In Thor 2, he wa in a cell for his crimes, alone and isolated with the only company of his mother who would astroproject herself to see him. His adopted father literally sent him there to be alone, a punnishment worse than death as Loki asked for it. His mother dies, then he takes the throne of Asgard at the end by casting a spell on Odin after faking his death. Yeh, a lot. But he is still looking after Asgard, showing he is a decent king, just needs to do better with the relationships with bordering realms. However, he seems to calm down in the third Thor movie as he helps his brother along the way. His adopted father makes amends with him and he is even sad about his death even though he was misstreated. There was a lot of fighting, betrayal, but loki turned to the light at the end. My man just wanted some love from the people he cared about. He even died trying to kill the pyscho purple alien, kind of stupid, but heroic. Anyway, he aint a villan, I mean look at him, okay, well he does look like one and tends to stab peoeple in the back. But at least he loves his family.
